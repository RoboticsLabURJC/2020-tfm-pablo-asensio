## Purpose

In this master's thesis we want to integrate two exercises in the [RoboticsAcademy](http://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/) platform of the [JdeRobot organization](https://jderobot.github.io/).
These exercises deal with the following topics:

- 🌏 3D visual odometry. [Here](https://github.com/PabloAsensio/MonocularVisualOdometry/) you can find the repository where I am working before integration on the web.
- 🗺  Visual SLAM

We could divide this project into 4 main phases:

- 👷 Pre-integration of the visual odometry exercise. (Currenly working here in this [repository](https://github.com/PabloAsensio/MonocularVisualOdometry/)).
- ❌ Integration of the visual odometry exercise on the web.
- ❌ Pre-integration of the visual SLAM exercise.
- ❌ Integration of the visual SLAM exercise on the web.

Also there exist other targets to complete:

- 📑 The redaction of the thesis. 
- 🚑 The maintenance of the blog.
- 🔎 The updating of old repositories if it is requiered.
