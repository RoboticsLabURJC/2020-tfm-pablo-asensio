<p>Due to Masterâ€™s exams and practical works I didnâ€™t update this page. Following, I resume my progresses during this period.</p>

<h2 id="compile-vio-slam-from-the-vio-sdslam-branch-of-the-jderobotsdslam-repository">Compile VIO-SLAM from the vio-sdslam branch of the JdeRobot/SDslam repository</h2>

<p>Basicly, I had to do the same work as the 1st week. Them I had to check if its works well.</p>

<h2 id="check-if-sdslam-works-properly">Check if SDslam works properly</h2>

<p>First of all, I had to download the EuRoC Dataset, following JdeRobot/SDslam vio-sdslam instructions.</p>

<p>Using the following sentence rans the SDslam with IMU data.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./Examples/Fusion/monocular_imu Examples/Monocular/EuRoC.yaml dataset/mav0/cam0/data  dataset/mav0/imu0/data.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we can see and check, SDslam works properly.</p>

<h2 id="check-if-vio-sdslam-works-properly">Check if VIO-SDslam works properly</h2>

<p>VIO-SDslam works with Kitti Dataset, so I had to download the dataset, but the previous work from I have started this proyect, use just 10 different sequences. Each sequence size is around 20GB, so it takes so much time downloading Kitty. Also I modify a shell sript to improve the download.</p>

<p>I have seen there are two different .yaml configurations. First goes from 00-03 squences, and the last contains the rest.</p>

<p>First configuration seems to work well. But there are some issues.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/vio-sdslam1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<p>Issues are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When inertial mode (yellow) shuld exits, it doesnâ€™t. So much error is accumulated due to IMU naturality. And, SDslam doesnâ€™t relunch.</li>
  <li>On inertial mode, seems yaw edge be bloqued. Following picture show that. Should be a clean corner trayectory, but it doesnâ€™t.

</ul>

<p>With the second configuration, extra issues appears:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Image seems to be modified. Looks wierd.</li>
  <li>Takes long time to start SDslam.
