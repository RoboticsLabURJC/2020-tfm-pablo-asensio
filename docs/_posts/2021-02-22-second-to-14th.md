Due to Master's exams and practical works I didn't update this page. Following, I resume my progresses during this period.

## Compile VIO-SLAM from the vio-sdslam branch of the JdeRobot/SDslam repository 

Basicly, I had to do the same work as the 1st week. Them I had to check if its works well.

## Check if SDslam works properly

First of all, I had to download the EuRoC Dataset, following JdeRobot/SDslam vio-sdslam instructions.

Using the following sentence rans the SDslam with IMU data.
```
./Examples/Fusion/monocular_imu Examples/Monocular/EuRoC.yaml dataset/mav0/cam0/data  dataset/mav0/imu0/data.csv
```

As we can see and check, SDslam works properly.

## Check if VIO-SDslam works properly

VIO-SDslam works with Kitti Dataset, so I had to download the dataset, but the previous work from I have started this proyect, use just 10 different sequences. Each sequence size is around 20GB, so it takes so much time downloading Kitty. Also I modify a shell sript to improve the download.

I have seen there are two different .yaml configurations. First goes from 00-03 squences, and the last contains the rest.

First configuration seems to work well. But there are some issues.

Issues are:
- When inertial mode (yellow) shuld exits, it doesn't. So much error is accumulated due to IMU naturality. And, SDslam doesn't relunch.
- On inertial mode, seems yaw edge be bloqued. Following picture show that. Should be a clean corner trayectory, but it doesn't.

With the second configuration, extra issues appears:
- Image seems to be modified. Looks odd.
- Takes long time to start SDslam.

## Conclusions of this weeks

We finally have previous code working. But we need to wait answers from VIO_SDslam author to verify the issues.

## Next week advance

I have to work with a [drone aproximation dataset](https://gsyc.urjc.es/jmplaza/slam/) to veryfy if VIO-SDslam works well in a 3D enviroment.
